            Initially Started small App development using Java and then checking out on Kotlin and Dart. When I first created my App : AI Contact App (which saved contacts of my friends and it had interactive features when the mobile was shook and so on.) Then picked
            up interest on Game Development, Started using Unity and studing C# via youtube and other resources. Then I started making games and publishing them on Play Store and Itch.io. During the Pandemic, Began building Discord Bots and was very much
            into Bot Development, Created bots using both Javascript and Pythons which has more than 1k invites. And now I am a CTO, Mentor, Developer and Member of various Clubs.
